# Code Of Conception

**This is just a general statement that applies to all my repositories unless stated otherwise.**

  The repositories that belong to my account are all made open source for educational purposes. I made these to test and share my skills as I grow as a developer and embark on a journey through different languages and software types. While some of the code here may be used for malicious purposes, I in no way use these for malicious purposes or invite you, by making these open source, to use them in malicous ways. 
  
  I will not be held responsible for any actions that people who fork and/or use this software take part in. I simply made these to make it easier for myself and others to reference and see examples of code that may be useful in many different ways. I hope you enjoy my work and get some use out of it on your own journey throughout programming.
